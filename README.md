# Atom wrap in tag

> :rotating_light: **NOTE!** This plug-inis no longer maintained. It probably works and PRs probably will be merged, but I do not use Atom anymore (sorry). If anyone want to maintain this, I'll be happy to give commit rights or transfer it.

Simplest package for [Atom](https://atom.io/) that wraps tag around selection - similar functionality found on other editors like PhpStorm, SublimeText, TextMate etc.

Just select a word or phrase and hit <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd>

Hit spacebar key to continue typing attribute after the opening tag.

## Installation

`apm install atom-wrap-in-tag`

or find _atom-wrap-in-tag_ in **Settings** > **Install** tab
